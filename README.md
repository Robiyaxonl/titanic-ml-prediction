# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction with Scikit-learn

This project builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using structured data.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset
Used the Titanic dataset from Seaborn (similar to Kaggle version).

## 📊 Model Performance
- Applied logistic regression and decision tree classifiers
- Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and evaluated accuracy

## 👩‍💻 Author
**Robiyaxon Otaboyeva**

## 🧠 Future Work
- Try ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy
- Deploy as a web app
